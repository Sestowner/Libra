Android app that helps making hard decisions. Works like this:

1. Write down pros and cons
2. Weigh every argument by swiping left or right over it
3. When everything's weighted you get a recommendation

Inspired by this [Time article][time-article].

Wrote this app to get my feet wet with Kotlin. Still mixed feelings.
